The main difference between the stack and the queue is that stack arranges elements in LIFO, while the queue arranges elements in FIFO.

The similarities between stack and queue is that they are all a collection of objects which are arranged in an ordered-line.

UNDO & REDO: we can use stack data structure since both actions require the latest action we take => LIFO.


1.
var reverse = (string)=>{
  let stack = [];
  let newString = '';
  for (var i = 0; i<string.length; i++){
      stack.push(string.charAt(i));
  }
  while (!stack.length == 0){
    newString +=stack.pop();
  }
    return newString;
  }

reverse('bloc')

2.
 pop = (arr) => {
  let count = 0;

  while (count < arr.length-1) {
    arr.push(arr.shift())
    count++;
  }

  return arr.shift();
}

pop([1,4,5])

3.

class Queue {
  constructor (items) {
    this.items = items;
  }

  enqueue (item) {
    this.items.push(item);
    return this.items;
  }

  dequeue () {
    return this.items.shift();
  }
}

let student = new Queue([2,4,5]);
student.enqueue(4);
student.dequeue();
