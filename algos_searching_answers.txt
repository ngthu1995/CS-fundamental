1. Real life scenario using linear search: a grocery list of items you want to buy.

2. Reallife scenratio using binary search: search a specific term in dictionary.

3. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, it would take 7 iterations to find the value G using linear search

4. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, it would take 3 iterations to find the value G using binary search.

5. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, we have to use linear search since binary search is only available when the collection is sorted.

6. Given a sorted collection of a million items, we would use binary search since it would take less iterations than linear search.


1. 

function lookUp(arr, word) {
        let left = 0;
        let right = arr.length - 1;

                left = mid + 1;
            } else  if (arr[mid] > word) {
                right = mid - 1;
            }else{
                return arr[mid] +  " is the " + ( mid + 1) + "rd word in the list."
            }

        return word + ` is not in the list.`;
    }

var words = ["Air", "Apple", "Bobcat", "Can", "Dice", "Destiny"];
console.log(lookUp(words, "Bobcat"));

2.  
var fishLookUp = (fishTank, fish) => {
    const found = fishTank.find( fish1 => {
        return fish1 === fish
    }) 
    if (found) {
      return true;
    } else return false;

}

var tank = ["goldfish", "goldfish", "one fish", "blue fish", "white-spotted goldfish", "Nemo"];
fishLookUp(tank, "blue fish")
